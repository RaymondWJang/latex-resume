Miniscope Project, Neuroscience Discovery Group \hfill \textsl{Jan 2019 - Apr 2021}

\begin{list2}
    \item {Constructed a data analysis pipeline that streamlines the process of extracting the behavior modulated neuronal activities from raw data, which became the internal standard analysis package for the laboratory.}
    \item {Developed a wireless brain imaging device that can be implanted on live, unrestrained animals. Oversaw the circuit design, microcontroller codes, and data and power streaming protocols, leading to the introduction or improvement of 7+ features while maintaining the same power consumption.}
    \item {The wireless design received a 1.4 million dollar grant from the National Institute of Health for its large-scale piloting experiment and is currently deployed in various UC labs.}
